# Booleans
# Booleans, just like many other languages are operators that allow you to convey true of false statements.
# They are mostly used in control flows and logic
truth = True
lies = False
both = None # This is also called the noe data type (NoneType). used to store variables we dont want to assign yet

print(truth)
print(type(lies)) # returns the class type of the variable stored in lies
